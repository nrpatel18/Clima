# Clima
Clima is a location-aware weather app (MVC) allowing users to check current weather for a location.

1. In order to obtain live weather data for a specific location provided by the user, HTTP requests and APIs were utilized.

2. The JSON data retrieved was then parsed through the implementation of native Encodable and Decodable protocols. Additionally, functionality was added through the use of Grand Central Dispatch and Core Location.
